# cgrn-repository-web-app
This repo contains the code for the an updated version of the cGRN repository developed by Shrey Gupta during the 2013 TGen Helios Scholars Internship. This system is based primarily on Node.js, Neo4j (for graph queries), and MongoDB (for user accounts). The system is to be deployed as a web application with full global access and multi-user functionality, along with a variety of cosmetic UI changes and backend code refactoring.
